#Substitution Cipher Cracker
##What is in here
This is a simple winforms application to help you crack a message cracked by the substitution cipher without knowing the key
It is by no means perfect and completely autonomus, but it speeds up the time to crack the message. 
##How it works
the program takes the longest word and swaps the letters of that word with another word of the same lenght in the text file. After that if there are weird 2 letter words it filters them (in italian words most 2 character words are not a lot, for example there isnt RC, so it would remove that)
